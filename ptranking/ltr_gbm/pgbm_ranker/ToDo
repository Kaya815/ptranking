TODO-note: negative symbol (according to the GBDT-related equation)?
 for gradient computation ?!
this setting really matters, which should be carefully checked!


ToDo:
2. integrate into ptranking, including gbdt, pgbm for probabilistic ranking
-> early stopping
-> validation

1. compare papers, and confirm the details on parameter setting, e.g., negative symbol

3. ...


todo-1:
since the prediction of pgbm is a distribution, a candidate objective function for ranking
can be the expected nDCG.
Main issue will be the computation of gradient, hessian w.r.t. expected nDCG.
!!! Put another, it requires manual computation due to the per-query computation of gradient, hessian.


todo-2:
to be discussed issue:
when using gbm based methods for ranking, the current models train like the following:
1> train one tree based on all data (inner will be query by query due the ranking_size is different from query to query);

how to adaptively determine the order to trees and query examples?
