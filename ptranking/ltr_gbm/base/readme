## Structure clarification ##
# the current implementation is based on the 2022.11.29 - version of pgbm: https://github.com/elephaint/pgbm
"""
Gradient boosting machines (GBMs) is the parent-level class object, which will be extended as
(1) traditional gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT);
(2) probabilistic gradient boosting machines (PGBM);

The common components between GBDT and PGBM are as follows:
_create_X_splits
_create_feature_bins

The differences between GBDT and PGBM are as follows:
<1> from the view of theoretical comparison:
for both a tree and a forest, GBDT's output is a deterministic estimation,
PGBM's output is a distribution (e.g., mu and variance in the case of gaussian estimation).
<2> from the view of implementation:
the implementation of the following functions are customized:
_create_tree
_leaf_prediction
_predict_tree
_predict_forest
train
predict
